/**
 * @mainpage DistrIRC
 *
 * DistrIRC is an advanced IRC client. It is destined to be usable as client,
 * bot, relay or bouncer on very different setups.
 *
 * The main motivation is to use two programs on two different machines: a
 * relay on some shell that is always connected to the Internet, and a client
 * on a desktop machine that will appear to stay online thanks to the relay,
 * and will be able to access the logs seemlessly. In that aspect, it is very
 * similar to <a href="http://quassel-irc.org/">Quassel</a>, but it can also be
 * used in more complicated setups. It also tries to conform to the IRC
 * protocol (for the relayed connections).
 *
 * See the @link protocol protocol overview @endlink for more information.
